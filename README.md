# General
Compares peptide and kinase results of two projects with the same design (repeated projects).

# File naming
Save phosphosite and kinase analysis result files (BioNavigator or Tercen) of the two projects in separate folders.
In each folder, the files should have the exact same naming. 
In each file, the namespaces should be exactly the same.

Name files the same as for automated reporting. 
Examples:
* MTvC_PTK_01_TvsC_LogFC.txt
* TT_STK_01_TvsC_p.txt
* TT_STK_01_TvsC.csv
* UKA_STK_01_TvsC.txt
